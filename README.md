# **Fake News Detection Project**  

## **Overview**  
This project aims to detect **fake news** using **machine learning techniques**. It involves **data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation** to classify news articles as **real or fake**.  

## **Project Structure**  
📂 `2021491368 Fake news detection code (1).ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full implementation  
📝 `2021491368 Fake news detection code.py` – Python script version  
🌐 `2021491368 Fake news detection code.html` – Exported HTML version of the notebook  
📄 `README.md` – Documentation (this file)  

## **Dependencies**  
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy sklearn nltk
```

## **How It Works**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load the dataset  
   - Clean text data (removing special characters, punctuations, etc.)  
   - Tokenization and stopword removal  

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Convert text into a numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train machine learning models like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM**  
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy using test data  

4. **Prediction**  
   - Input new text and classify it as **Fake or Real**  

## **How to Run**  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter and run all cells  
- **Python Script:** Run the following command in your terminal:  
  ```bash
  python 2021491368\\ Fake\\ news\\ detection\\ code.py
  ```  

## **Future Enhancements**  
✅ Implement Deep Learning models like **LSTMs or Transformers**  
✅ Integrate the model with a **web application for real-time fake news detection**  
✅ Improve dataset size and quality to enhance accuracy
